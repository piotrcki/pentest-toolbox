This project is just another offensive cybersecurity toolbox within a container.

The container is based on [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).

It is made to be used in command line attached to a `docker` process
 (i.e., running `sudo docker run -t -i --rm piotrcki/pentest-toolbox`).

To discover included tools and configuration, read the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

Pulling Image from Docker Hub
=============================

```
sudo docker image pull piotrcki/pentest-toolbox
```

**Security Warning:** Since [DockerHub disabled image building for free accounts]
(https://www.docker.com/blog/changes-to-docker-hub-autobuilds/),
I have built this image on my personal laptop.
This is not the most secure build system I can dream about, but it's consistent with my threat model.
Yours may differ from mine, especially if you don't trust me or if you care about nation-state bad actors.
